What we want is for you to think about how you can make something creative and useful from the various things you have worked on, while you have been improving and learning. For instance, if you decide to submit a notebook with a regression supported by some good visualizations, that would be just fine. It’s not the quantity we are after.\n","The submission should hovewer have multiple notebooks for the different parts (please do not do superlong messy notebooks with endless outputs) and at least one Streamlit app (deployed! - and working) demonstrating the functionality. \n"," \n","\n","Also, the submissions are not graded directly.\n"," \n"," \n","Feel free to ask here if you have further questions."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# **M1 Exam Submission**\n","\n"," * Business Problem: \n","\n"," * Objectives:\n","\n","## **Table of Contents**\n","\n","#### I.
